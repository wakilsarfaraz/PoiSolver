# PoiSolver
PoiSolver is a Finite Element Solver written in R for Poisson equation. PoiSolver employes piecewise linear basis functions on uniform triangulation. It solves a Poisson equation on a two dimensional rectangular domain with homogeneous boundary conditions of Dirichlet type. We illustrate PoiSolver through an example in which we present both the relevant theory of the finite element method a long with the implementation for a given example.
